# SuperKey Python Interfae

This directory contains the Python API wrapper for SuperKey (the `superkey` library). The intent of this library is to
provide a "reference implementation" for working with SuperKey's serial protocol, as well as to provide a way for users
to script SuperKey's functionality.

`superkey` has no dependencies other than the built-in Python standard library. A future improvement is to improve the
packaging for this library, to make it more consumable by other Python projects.

See the [Python Guide](https://github.com/xchrishawk/superkey/wiki/Python-Guide) on the wiki for more details.
