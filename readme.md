# SuperKey

**SuperKey** - the greatest CW keyer the world has ever seen. (Someday, hopefully).

SuperKey is a fully featured, open source CW / Morse code keyer for amateur radio operators. The goal of SuperKey is to
provide **all keyer functionality** required by the modern ham radio enthusiast, as simply and cheaply as possible.
SuperKey is **100% open source**, and always will be - you are free to build, modify, and tinker with your own SuperKey.

## Features

SuperKey provides many useful features for hams:

- Supports **all types of CW keys** ‚Äî straight key, paddles, bugs, sideswipers, etc.

- Supports **all common paddle modes** ‚Äî iambic, ultimatic, etc.

- Supports **all types of radios** ‚Äî if it has a keyer input, you can connect a SuperKey to it.

- Connects **multiple keys to a single radio** ‚Äî no need to choose between straight key and paddles!

- Connects **multiple radios to a single key** ‚Äî if that's something you need to do (ü§®), SuperKey can do it for you.

- Allows **keyboard text entry and automatic Morse code generation** with autokeyer support.

- Supports speeds from **1 WPM to 100 WPM**, with **exact timing control** of all Morse code elements.

- Keyer output is **millisecond accurate**, verified by oscilloscope.

- Hardware **LED and buzzer output** ‚Äî practice when you're away from your radio, even silently!

- Supports a **robust serial interface**, allowing tight integration with third-party software.

- All functionality is **programmable via a Python library**, allowing advanced use cases.

## Hardware

SuperKey is under active development as of August 2025. The prototype hardware is continuing to evolve, and new features
are being added continuously. Once a basic design has been finalized, I will upload a bill of materials and CAD files
for the PCB. The current plan is for SuperKey to be equipped with at least the following hardware:

- [Microchip ATmega1284P](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATmega1284p) microcontroller
- [FTDI FT232](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/datasheets/ftdi/ft232r) USB-to-TTL adapter
- Four 1/8" TRS sockets, for a total of eight fully configurable I/O pins.
- USB-Mini connector providing power and a serial connection to the PC.
- Auxiliary UART for debugging.
- Two LEDs (unit status and keyer output).
- One piezo buzzer with configurable audio frequency.

Power is provided via the USB connector. I also plan to add a hardware user interface of some sort, to allow performing
basic functions without requiring a PC connection. The details for this are TBD.
