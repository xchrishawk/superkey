# SuperKey

**SuperKey** - the greatest CW keyer the world has ever seen.

SuperKey is a fully featured, open source CW / Morse code keyer for amateur radio operators. The goal of SuperKey is to
provide **all keyer functionality** required by the modern ham radio enthusiast, as simply and cheaply as possible.
SuperKey is **100% open source**, and always will be - you are free to build, modify, and tinker with your own SuperKey.

## Features

SuperKey provides many useful features for hams:

- Supports **all types of CW keys** â€” straight key, paddles, bugs, sideswipers, etc.

- Supports **all common paddle modes** â€” iambic, ultimatic, etc.

- Supports **all types of radios** â€” if it has a keyer input, you can connect a SuperKey to it.

- Connects **multiple keys to a single radio** â€” no need to choose between straight key and paddles!

- Connects **multiple radios to a single key** â€” if that's something you need to do (ðŸ¤¨), SuperKey can do it for you.

- Allows **keyboard text entry and automatic Morse code generation** with autokeyer support.

- Supports speeds from **1 WPM to 100 WPM**, with **exact timing control** of all Morse code elements.

- Keyer output is **millisecond accurate**, verified by oscilloscope.

- Hardware **LED and buzzer output** â€” practice when you're away from your radio, even silently!

- All functionality is **programmable via a Python interface**, allowing advanced use cases.

SuperKey is under active development as of August 2025. The prototype hardware is continuing to evolve, and new features
are being added continuously.
