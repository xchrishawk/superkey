# SuperKey

**SuperKey** - the greatest CW keyer the world has ever seen.

SuperKey is a fully featured, open source CW / Morse code keyer for amateur radio operators. The goal of SuperKey is to
provide **all keyer functionality** required by the modern ham radio enthusiast, as simply and cheaply as possible.
SuperKey is **100% open source**, and always will be - you are free to build, modify, and tinker with your own SuperKey.

## Features

SuperKey provides many useful features for hams:

- Supports **all types of CW keys** — straight key, paddles, bugs, sideswipers, etc.
- Supports **all common paddle modes**  — iambic, ultimatic, etc.
- Allows **keyboard text entry and automatic Morse code generation** in Autokey mode.
- Device is **configured and controlled by computer** connected to the USB port.

The SuperKey hardware has:

- Three fully configurable TRS inputs (6 pins total).
- One fully configurable TRS output (2 pins total).
- One USB-B connector for computer data and power.
- One (optional) "keyer on" buzzer with configurable audio frequency.
- One (optional) "keyer on" LED.
